## This Pokémon Let's Go Deal Is the Very Best, Like No Deal Ever Was

If you haven’t picked up the nostalgia bomb that is Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee/Pikachu, you can grab either one (hint: get the Eevee version) for \$45 today on Amazon, a new all-time low price.

These games are basically modern, 3D remakes of the original Red and Blue games that you played on your Gameboy, and while they’re a bit easy by modern Pokémon standards, the series has never looked so good.
